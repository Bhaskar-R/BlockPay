# PaymentSystem

The PaymentSystem folder contains the code for a contactless payment system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an RC522 RFID reader. This system enables secure and efficient contactless payments in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment.

## Hardware Setup

To set up the PaymentSystem, you will need the following components:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- RC522 RFID reader
- Breadboard and jumper wires

Follow these steps to set up the hardware:

1. Connect the RC522 RFID reader to the ESP32 microcontroller using jumper wires. Make sure to connect the appropriate pins according to the wiring configuration given in the connections image.

2. Double-check the connections to ensure they are secure and properly aligned.

## Software Setup

To compile and upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller, we will be using PlatformIO, an open-source ecosystem for embedded development. Follow the steps below to set up the software environment:

1. Install PlatformIO on your computer by following the instructions provided in the official documentation: [PlatformIO Installation Guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html)

2. Open the PaymentSystem folder in your preferred code editor.

3. If you haven't already, connect the ESP32 microcontroller to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Build and upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller using PlatformIO. This can typically be done by selecting the appropriate upload command in your code editor or by using the PlatformIO command line interface.

5. After the code is successfully uploaded, the PaymentSystem should be ready to use.

## Usage

To use the PaymentSystem, follow these steps:

1. Power on the ESP32 microcontroller.

2. Hold an RFID card or tag close to the RC522 RFID reader.

3. The system will detect the card and display the relevant information on the connected display or serial monitor.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the payment process.

5. Once the payment is processed, the system will provide a confirmation message.

6. Repeat the process for subsequent payments.
