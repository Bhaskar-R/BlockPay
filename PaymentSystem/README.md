# PaymentSystem

The PaymentSystem folder contains the code for a contactless payment system using an ESP32 microcontroller and an RC522 RFID reader. This system enables secure and efficient contactless payments in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment.

## Setup and Usage

To set up and use the PaymentSystem, follow these steps:

1. Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to the RC522 RFID reader according to the provided hardware diagram.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   - Install the Arduino IDE from [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Install the MFRC522 library by going to **Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries** in the Arduino IDE. Search for "MFRC522" and click the "Install" button for the library developed by Miguel Balboa.

3. Open the `PaymentSystem.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

4. Select the appropriate board and port:
   - Go to **Tools -> Board** and select "ESP32 Dev Module" or the relevant board option.
   - Go to **Tools -> Port** and select the port where the ESP32 is connected.

5. Customize the settings (e.g., Wi-Fi credentials, payment methods) in the `PaymentSystem.ino` file according to your requirements. Refer to the comments in the code for guidance.

6. Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller.

7. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE (**Tools -> Serial Monitor**) to view the system output and debug messages.

8. Follow the on-screen instructions displayed in the serial monitor to perform contactless payments. You can use the provided RFID cards or tags for testing.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the PaymentSystem is as follows:

- `PaymentSystem.ino`: The main Arduino sketch file that contains the code for the contactless payment system.
- `lib`: A folder containing the necessary libraries used in the PaymentSystem.
- `hardware_diagram.png`: A hardware diagram illustrating the connections between the ESP32 microcontroller and the RC522 RFID reader.

## Dependencies

The PaymentSystem relies on the following libraries:

- MFRC522 library by Miguel Balboa: [https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)

Make sure to install these libraries as mentioned in the setup instructions.
