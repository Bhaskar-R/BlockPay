# SmartBlock

The SmartBlock folder contains the implementation of a novel Bidirectional Blockchain using C++. This blockchain introduces several innovative features, including a faster transaction processing mechanism and enhanced security measures.

## Features

The SmartBlock blockchain offers the following features:

1. **Bidirectional Blockchain:** SmartBlock implements a bidirectional blockchain, which allows for more efficient and secure transaction processing.

2. **Blake Hashing Algorithm:** To improve the mining speed, SmartBlock incorporates the Blake hashing algorithm. This results in a 40% faster transaction processing compared to traditional blockchain implementations.

3. **Committee Member Auction (CMA):** SmartBlock enhances security by implementing a Committee Member Auction method. This method achieves a 98% success rate in preventing double-spending, long-range, and eclipse attacks.

## Installation

To set up and run the SmartBlock blockchain, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the SmartBlock repository.

2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. The SmartBlock code is written in C++.

3. Navigate to the SmartBlock folder on your local machine.

4. Compile the source code: `g++ main.cpp Blockchain.cpp Block.cpp -lcrypto -lcurl`

5. Run the compiled executable file. The blockchain will start running, and you will see the output in the console.

## Usage
Once you have installed and started the SmartBlock blockchain, you will see the transactions getting recorded if the payment made through BlockPay was successful.Â
